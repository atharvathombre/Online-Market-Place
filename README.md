# Online Market Place

The motivation to build Online Market Place was that I saw many of my seniors when passed out from college, often left their stuff like air coolers, books behind, and someone stole them. So, to avoid this situation, a student who can use that stuff can buy the same from this Online Market Place, but sadly, we could not launch this project on the college campus due to the pandemic. 
Online Market Place is built using Django Framework of Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

To run this project, you first need to clone this repository.
And then, make Online-Market-Place your current working directory.
Use the following command in your terminal window to install all the necessary packages.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

After installing all the necessary packages, you can run this project on your machine using the following command.

```python3 manage.py runserver```

This command will start the development server. Click the development server link to access the project.

Now you will see a login page. If not already registered, register first, and then you will receive a mail on the registered email address to confirm your email. After email confirmation, log in using the email and password.

You will now see the homepage.

How to Buy an item:
Click Buy on the homepage, search your desired item in the search bar and click the search button. The search results will appear.

Click on Show Interest to send the request to the seller. After the seller accepts your request, you will now chat with the seller and ask your concern doubts, go to Social and then texts to see all the text messages.

After the seller confirms the shipment, go to Social and then Confirmations to verify that you received the product after receiving it.
After that, the transaction is completed, and you can now view the transactions on the All Transactions page.

How to Sell an item:
Click Sell on the homepage, click the button Create AD to create a new AD. Enter the product details and click Upload to generate the AD. All your ADs appear on the Sell page.

After receiving the buyer's interest, to accept that interest go to Socials and then Interests and then received Interests.

Confirm the shipment by going to Socials, then Confirmations, and then 'To be Shipped'. After the buyer gets the product and confirms it, you can see the transaction on the 'All Transactions' page.

The exact process is for Rent and Lease pages.

To log out,  use the 'Log Out' button. 
To change the password, use the 'Change Password' button.
